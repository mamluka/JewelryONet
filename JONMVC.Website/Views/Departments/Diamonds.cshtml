    <h1>
        Choosing the Right Diamond<br />
    </h1>
    <p>
        After a lifetime of searching, you have finally found the person that you want to
        be with forever, and now it's time to choose the diamond that will represent your
        promise of &quot;eternal love,&quot; and propose.
        <br />
        Choosing the right diamond demands some knowledge of the basic characteristics of
        these gems.
        <br />
        When buying a diamond, whether as an engagement present, a gift for a loved one,
        or as an investment for yourself, it is imperative that you know something about
        diamonds.<br />
        No matter how much research you do, and no matter how much time you spend on the
        process, remember one key element: Enjoy the Experience! This is supposed to be
        a fun time for both of you, so do your research, but don't become overwhelmed in
        the process.<br />
        Every book on diamond education and every web site dedicated to diamond buying will
        tell you the same thing: you can't start the diamond buying process without first
        learning about the 4 C's. Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat Weight are the four C's
        that will determine the diamond&rsquo;s characteristics. Deciding on your budget
        is an important first step. Another thing to keep in mind is that even though you
        are the person making the purchase, your significant other will be the one that
        it adorns for the rest of their life.
        <br />
        In just a few minutes you'll know everything you need to know to find your perfect
        diamond.</p>
    <h2>
        Cut:<br />
    </h2>
    <p>
        A good cut is essential to a diamond's beauty, because even a diamond with outstanding
        color and clarity will not display the sparkle that diamonds are famous for if its
        components don't interact with light as they should. We recommend selecting the
        highest cut grade within your budget.
        <br />
        The reason is simple: of the Four Cs, no other characteristic has a greater influence
        on a diamond's appearance.</p>
    <h2>
        Color:<br />
    </h2>
    <p>
        The most desirable diamonds have the least color. Most of us use the range of near-colorless
        to more of a yellow-brown coloration, designated by letters of the alphabet ranging
        from D-Z. The D's are nearly colorless, the less color the higher the value. Any
        small color difference can affect the value significantly. At JewelryONet, you'll
        find only the finest diamonds with color graded D-J, Diamonds graded J or better
        are colorless or near-colorless, with color that is typically undetectable to the
        naked eye.</p>
    <h2>
        Clarity:<br />
    </h2>
    <p>
        Almost all diamonds contain inclusions, small trace minerals or scratches, these
        inclusions detract from the diamond's value. The most valuable diamonds are flawless,
        but these are very expensive, and very rare. Diamonds with higher clarity grades
        are more valued, with the exceedingly rare &quot;flawless&quot; graded diamond fetching
        the highest price. Because these imperfections tend to be microscopic, they do not
        generally affect a diamond's beauty in any discernible way.</p>
    <h2>
        Carat Weight:<br />
    </h2>
    <p>
        Carat is the term used to express the weight of a diamond, with one carat equaling
        200 milligrams of actual weight. The weight of smaller diamonds is often expressed
        as points, not carats.
        <br />
        There are 100 points in a carat. Another way to look at it is to say that each point
        equals 0.01, or one-hundredth, of a carat. Larger diamonds are rarer and in more
        demand than smaller diamonds of the same quality, so they can be sold for a higher
        price. A one carat diamond solitaire ring is nearly always more expensive than a
        diamond ring made up of multiple diamonds that are similar, but smaller,
        <br />
        even though they total one carat or more.</p>
